# Python LS Command

This project is a simple Python script that mimics the behavior of the `ls` command in Linux.  
It lists the files and directories in the current working directory or a specified path.

---

## Features

- List all files and directories in a given path.
- Optionally list hidden files.
- Can be extended to include additional `ls` options.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:AhmadNW/Python_Project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/PythonProject1
```

3. Run the script:
```bash
python ls_clone.py
```

4. Optional: Provide a directory path as argument:
```bash
python ls_clone.py C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/PythonProject1
```

---

## Example Output

```bash
$ python ls_clone.py
file1.txt
file2.py
directory1
directory2
```

---

## Notes

- This script is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates basic file system operations in Python.
- It does not support all flags of the real `ls` command, but can be extended.
